	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	    We review, in this article, a list of problems in the Pfizer/BioNTech C4591001 Trial, which came out in our attempts to reproduce the results provided by the study. 
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Using the sponsor's data communicated to the FDA, and made available via the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency's Freedom Of Information request & lawsuits, we are able to demonstrate that multiple abnormalities are affecting the populations featured in the trial - to a proportion which may have affected the end result, <b>primarily judged on a 170 patients efficacy sub-set</b>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    In that course, most interesting articles were brought to our attention, by the DailyClout's team 3, Jeyanthi Kunadhasan, MD (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/Jkun85" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), Ed Clark, MSE, and Chris Flowers, MD (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/chrisflowersmd" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), and by anonymous whistle-blower Arkmedic (<a href="https://t.me/arkmedic" target="_blank">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://gab.com/arkmedic" target="_blank">Gab</a> | <a href="https://arkmedic.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>), highlighting multiple abnormalities in the trial.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Benefiting from their precious insights, and desiring to verify and to be able to support their figures, we dived in with Geoff Pain, PHD  (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/GeoffPainPhD" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), and are sharing here our preliminary findings, which, we hope, will simplify the accessibility of the data for other researchers who may want to study this critically important clinical trial.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    People desiring to study the trial may also benefit from the reading of this report of interest by biostatistician Christine Cotton, <a href="https://christine-cotton.1ere-page.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ENG-Vaccine-expertise-GCP-CCotton-2022-02-14-v2_AC.pdf" target="_blank">"Evaluation of the methodological practices implemented in the Pfizer/BioNtech" trials in the development of its COVID-19 RNA-messenger vaccine in relation to Good Clinical Practices"</a>, whose summary <a href="https://twitter.com/StatChrisCotton/status/1598398931381223440" target="_blank">you can find here</a>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <h2>Preliminary facts reminder</h2>
	    The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine <b>"efficacy of 95%"</b> was announced, through the press, on November 18, 2020, as per example this New-York Times Article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html" target="_blank">New Pfizer Results: Coronavirus Vaccine Is Safe and 95% Effective</a>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    On November 20, 2020, as exposed on the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download" target="_blank">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for an Unapproved Product Review Memorandum</a>, the submission process for the EUA began. This process <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download" target="_blank">took some time and ended on December 10, 2020</a>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    On December 11, 2020, a day later, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6950e2.htm?s_cid=mm6950e2_w" target="_blank">the EUA was granted by the FDA</a>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Some of the <b>key dates</b> are summarized in the Timeline below.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		<div style="width:100%;overflow-x: auto;">
			<img src="/doc/pfizer_trials/TimelinePfizer.png">
		</div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    In the paper <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577" target="_blank">Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine</a>, published on December 31, 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM.org), by Fernando P. Polack et al., the World saw for the first time some details on the numbers backing this claim.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    As established by the document <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-060122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-publications.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">pd-production-060122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-publications.pdf</a>, page 31 & following, the study was finalized on December 16, 2020. This document also includes the previous studies published.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		<a href="https://phmpt.org/court-documents/" target="_blank">PHMPT's FOI & lawsuits</a> allowed the public to access the documents which were supposed to stay hidden for 75 years, and which are supporting the FDA EUA & the NEJM study.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    This data is therefore partially available, even if <b>key files required to reproduce the original code, such as the ADSL file (Subject-Level Analysis Data), are still not provided</b> when this study is written, on December 8, 2022.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    This lack of transparency hasn't evolved despite <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj.o1731/rr-1" target="_blank">this recent letter from Peter Doshi to the BMJ</a> on October 07, 2022.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		The <b>Data Cut-off dates</b> featured in the NEJM study are unclear, and therefore clarified hereafter.
		<ul>
			<li>Efficacy subset data cut-off was <b>November 14</b> - but given 7 days were required post dose 2, no patient injected post November 7 was included</li>
			<div class="text_separator"></div>
			<li>Safety subset data cut-off was <b>October 9</b> (at least 2 months of follow-up post dose 1)</li>
		</ul>
		The stated <b>Interval between injections</b> of 21 days, in the NEJM study, is misleading. As illustrated in the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577/suppl_file/nejmoa2034577_protocol.pdf" target="_blank">NEJM protocol, page 347</a> & the table 2 of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download" target="_blank">FDA Memorandum, page 18</a>, the delay is in reality an interval of <b>19 to 42 days</b>. This point was brought to our attention by The DailyClout's team 3's <a href="https://dailyclout.io/report-41-the-170-clinical-trial-participants-who-changed-the-world-pfizer-ignored-protocol-deviations-to-obtain-emergency-use-authorization-for-its-covid-19-mrna-vaccine/" target="_blank">Report 42: Pfizer’s EUA Granted Based on Fewer Than 0.4% of Clinical Trial Participants. FDA Ignored Disqualifying Protocol Deviations to Grant EUA</a>.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		This article also highlights several abnormalities which we encourage researchers to review.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<a href="/studies/pfizer_trial_cases_mapping?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">We mapped these cases</a>, which only highlighted the importance of site 1231, led by the NEJM study's lead author, Fernando Polack. <a href="/studies/verifying_170_cases?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">We verified the listing of the subjects sustained for the efficacy case</a> located by the DailyClout team 3</a>, and desired to calculate the infection rate by site.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    It must also be emphasized, as mentioned page 24 of <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-050222/125742_S1_M5_c4591001-S-csdrg.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">this document</a> that "virtual sites" were created and integrated in the patient "unique id". It is of importance as site 4444, virtual site of site 1231, often appears in the efficacy results.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		Last, as it had been already highlighted by Arkmedic (in one of his many former (censored) Twitter incarnations, Jikkyleaks, archived on Telegram <a href="https://t.me/jikkyleaks">here</a>), every swab analysis was made in the Pfizer's Pearl River laboratory in New York - even if local analysis had been performed by the trial site lab.

		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		This central lab prevalence is highlighted in the <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-030122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-protocol.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">Protocol from March 2, 2021</a>, while this precision doesn't figure in the November 27, 2020 <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-050222/125742_S1_M5_5351_bnt162-01-interim3-protocol.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">version of the protocol</a>.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		When a conflict was arising between the central laboratory results & the local laboratory result, the sole results sustained were the central laboratory results.

	    <h2>Methodology</h2>
	    Data has been automatically downloaded from the PHMPT's website, extracted & converted to processible files. The code has been written <a href="https://www.perl.org/" target="_blank">using Perl 5</a>, and the dependencies required are documented on <a href="/data?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">this page</a>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    The scripts & data are freely accessible, and detailed further in the <b>Methodology Details</b> section. Additional libraries (open source & freely accessible) have been documented when required.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <h2>Results</h2>
		We have used, to date, several type of useful sources in our attempts to reproduce the NEJM study calculations:
		<ul>
			<li>260 PDF Documents, detailed in the <a href="/doc/pfizer_trials/pfizer_pdf_files_subjects.xlsx" download>following .XLSX file</a></li>
			<li>80 XPT Files, detailed in the <a href="/doc/pfizer_trials/pfizer_sas_files_subjects.xlsx" download>following .XLSX file</a></li>
			<li>27 XLSX Files, dumps from SAS files</li>
		</ul>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    This paper focused on reproducing the figures communicated to the NEJM by Pfizer & Biontech as far as the efficacy subset was concerned. It led us to highlight that the figures featured in the NEJM study & in the FDA memorandum are vague, <b>and sometimes contradicting each other (1)</b>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		Most of the population figures featured in the study are in no way reproducible given the current state of the data and are <b>highlighting multiple anomalies (2)</b>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    It is also unclear why some patients haven't been included in the efficacy data while they appear to have tested positive prior the data cut-off - particularly in the NEJM article (4).
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		Lastly, a sequence of 8 subjects testing positive out of the sole Argentinian site appears quite <b>unlikely to have appeared by chance in the context of a fair, randomized trial (4).</b>

		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		As highlighted, the randomization data doesn't correspond between FDA & NEJM figures, with <b>103 more subjects</b> in the FDA memorandum.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		One of the rare points of accordance between these is that 43 448 subjects have been injected with a first dose. However, although that's one of the subjects details we have at disposal, attempts to reproduce these calculations according to the trial criteria have been unsuccessful.

			<li>Two SAS files are keeping track of <b>48 091 subjects</b> initiations.</li>

				<div class="text_separator"></div>

			</ul>
			<div class="text_separator"></div>
			<li>3108 of these subjects aren't appearing in any PDF file. A list of "44 959 subjects likely to have been screened" was generated parsing the PDF & SAS files - but this figure may include some rare duplicate subjects. When no screening date was documented, we evaluated it based in the display order of the .XPT file, after verifying that it was indeed incremental for the <b>44 404 subjects</b> for whom screening dates were known. The last subject (subject 44442322) also appears in the PDF demographic file as the last subject recruited by virtual site 4444 (site 1231) on <b>September 27, 2020</b>.</li>
			<div class="text_separator"></div>
			<li>We can speculate, based on this data, that the "44 820 subjects screened" quoted in NEJM Table's 1 has been established only integrating the sources with a green background. <b>Why subjects who are present in lab analytics, or in the ADVA file, would be excluded from the "screening scope", is unclear.</b></li>
			<div class="text_separator"></div>
			<li>Randomization data has been extracted for the PDF files. When no randomization data was available (102 subjects appearing in the ADVA files), the randomization date has been set to the first vaccination date (as is the case for most subjects). <b>It is unclear why we have a 5 subjects offset with the FDA Memorandum; and therefore a 108 subjects offset with the NEJM ones.</b></li>
			<div class="text_separator"></div>
			<li>The doses injected have been built using the randomization PDF files & the ADVA XPT file. It is unclear why <b>102 subjects</b> of the ADVA files aren't appearing in the Randomization files - along with why 27 subjects from the randomization files aren't in the ADVA file.</li>

		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		As a side note, while we find 43 655 subjects randomized, 43 661 patients were claimed to have been recruited by Pfizer & BioNTech in this article from the New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html" target="_blank">2 Companies Say Their Vaccines Are 95% Effective.

		To provide a raw approximate of the odds of 8 cases in a row appearing only in Argentina, while the other sites were silent, we ran a <a href="https://github.com/OpenVaet/openvaet/blob/main/tasks/pfizer_trials/monte_carlo_cases.pl" target="_blank">Monte Carlo simulation</a>, based on an incidence rate of :

		An imperfect evaluation, of course, as the high Argentinian Incidence rate is balanced by various unknown (couples among subjects, over-exposed healhcare workers, local variants).
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		We will refine the model used to take into account incidence rate by US state - data at city granularity being, unfortunately, very hard to find. How accurate is the fact of using John Hopkins' data to evaluate trial sites infection trends also requires further examination.

		Something one has to understand about the Pfizer trial documents released by PHMPT is that we have several editions of the same tables, which are completed by Pfizer & communicated to the FDA as the trial went along.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		For example, there are several editions of the table "16.2.8.1":
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		- One is labelled <i>"16.2.8.1 Listing of Subjects With Postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 NAAT-Positive Nasal Swab and COVID-19 Signs andSymptoms – Dose 1 All-Available Efficacy Population"</i>, which you can find in the file "pd-production-030122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-fa-interim-lab-measurements-sensitive.pdf", finalized on November 24, 2020.

	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	    Nous passons en revue, dans cet article, une liste de problèmes dans l'essai clinique Pfizer/BioNTech C4591001, mis en évidence par nos tentatives de reproduire les résultats fournis par l'étude.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		En utilisant la donnée communiquée par la FDA, et mise à disposition du public grâce aux requêtes et procès en Droit à l'information de l'association "Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency's Freedom Of Information" (PHMPT), nous pouvons démontrer que de nombreuses anomalies affectent les populations représentées dans l'essai clinique - dans une proportion qui pourrait avoir affecté les résultats finaux, <b>établis en premier lieu sur un sous-groupe de 170 sujets.</b>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Alors que nous étudiions ces données, des articles des plus intéressants nous ont été présentés par l'équipe 3 du DailyClout, Jeyanthi Kunadhasan, MD (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/Jkun85" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), Ed Clark, MSE, et Chris Flowers, MD (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/chrisflowersmd" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), et par le lanceur d'alerte anonyme Arkmedic (<a href="https://t.me/arkmedic" target="_blank">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://gab.com/arkmedic" target="_blank">Gab</a> | <a href="https://arkmedic.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>), mettant en lumière de nombreuses anomalies dans l'essai clinique.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Bénéficiant de leurs lumières précieuses, et désirant vérifier et confirmer leurs calculs, nous avons étudié l'essai avec Geoff Pain, PHD (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/GeoffPainPhD" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), et partageons nos découvertes préliminaires, qui, nous l'espérons, vont simplifier l'accessibilité des données pour les autres chercheurs qui seraient désireux d'étudier cet essai clinique de première importance.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Ceux qui seraient désireux d'étudier l'essai clinique pourront aussi bénéficier de la lecture de ce rapport par la biostatisticienne Christine Cotton, <a href="https://christine-cotton.1ere-page.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vaccine-expertise-GCP-CCotton-2022-02-28-French-v2_AC.pdf" target="_blank">"Evaluation des pratiques méthodologiques mises en oeuvre dans les essais Pfizer dans le développement de son vaccin ARM-messager contre la COVID-19 en regard des Bonnes Pratiques Cliniques"</a>, dont on trouve le <a href="https://twitter.com/StatChrisCotton/status/1599719427183808512" target="_blank">résumé ici</a>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <h2>Rappel préliminaire des faits</h2>
		<b>L' "efficacité à 95%"</b> du vaccin Pfizer/BioNTech a été annoncée par voie de presse, le 18 Novembre 2020, comme l'illustre par exemple cet article du New-York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html" target="_blank">New Pfizer Results: Coronavirus Vaccine Is Safe and 95% Effective</a>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		Le 20 Novembre 2020, comme exposé dans le <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download" target="_blank">Mémorandum d'autorisation d'utilisation d'urgence pour un produit non-approuvé</a>, le processus d'application pour l'EUA a été mis en route. Ce processus <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download" target="_blank">a pris quelque temps et s'est achevé le 10 Décembre 2020</a>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Le 11 Décembre 2020, le lendemain, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6950e2.htm?s_cid=mm6950e2_w" target="_blank">l'EUA a été accordée par la FDA</a>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Quelques unes des dates clés sont résumées dans la chronologie ci-dessous.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		<div style="width:100%;overflow-x: auto;">
			<img src="/doc/pfizer_trials/TimelinePfizerFR.png">
		</div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    C'est dans l'article <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577" target="_blank">Sûreté et Efficacité du BNT162b2 aRNM Vaccin Covid-19</a>, publié le 31 Décembre 2020 dans le New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM.org), par Fernando P. Polack et al., que le monde a découvert pour la première fois quelques détails plus précis sur les chiffres soutenant cette affirmation.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Comme établi dans le document <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-060122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-publications.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">pd-production-060122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-publications.pdf</a>, page 31 & suivantes, l'étude a été finalisée le 16 Décembre 2020. Ce document rappelle aussi les études précédemment publiées.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		Les <a href="https://phmpt.org/court-documents/" target="_blank">FOI & procès de PHMPT</a> ont permis au public d'accéder aux documents qui étaient supposés rester cachés pendant 75 ans, et qui soutiennent l'autorisation d'utilisation d'urgence de la FDA & l'étude du NEJM.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Ces données sont donc désormais partiellement disponibles, même si <b>des fichiers-clés requis pour reproduire le code d'origine, comme le fichier ADSL (Donnée d'analyse de niveau sujet), n'ont toujours pas été fournis</b> à la date de rédaction de cette étude, le 8 Décembre 2022.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Un manque de transparence qui se perpétue, malgré <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj.o1731/rr-1" target="_blank">cette lettre récente de Peter Doshi au BMJ</a>, le 7 Octobre 2022.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Les <b>dates limites des données</b> affichées dans le NEJM étant peu claires, nous les avons clarifiées ci-après.
		<ul>
			<li>La date limite des données pour le sous-groupe d'analyse d'efficacité était le <b>14 Novembre</b> - mais compte tenu des 7 jours requis post dose 2, aucun patient injecté après le 7 Novembre n'a été inclu.</li>
			<div class="text_separator"></div>
			<li>La date limite des données pour le sous-groupe d'analyse de sûreté était le <b>9 Octobre</b> (au moins deux mois de suivi depuis la dose 1)</li>
		</ul>
		<b>L'intervalle stipulé entre les injections</b> de 21 jours, dans l'étude du NEJM, est trompeuse. Comme illustré à la <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577/suppl_file/nejmoa2034577_protocol.pdf" target="_blank">page 347 du protocole de l'étude NEJM</a> & à la <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download" target="_blank">table 2 du Mémorandum FDA, page 18</a>, le délai était en pratique un interval de 19 à 42 jours. Ce point a été porté à notre attention par l'article de l'équipe 3 du DailyClout <a href="https://dailyclout.io/report-41-the-170-clinical-trial-participants-who-changed-the-world-pfizer-ignored-protocol-deviations-to-obtain-emergency-use-authorization-for-its-covid-19-mrna-vaccine/" target="_blank">Rapport 42 : L'EUA Pfizer accordée sur la base de 0.4% des participants à l'essai clinique. La FDA a ignoré des déviations de protocole disqualifiantes pour accorder l'EUA</a>.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		Cet article met aussi en lumière plusieurs anomalies que nous encourageons les chercheurs à parcourir.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<a href="/studies/pfizer_trial_cases_mapping?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">Nous avons cartographié ces cas</a>, ce qui a mis en lumière l'importance du site 1231, dirigé par l'auteur principal de l'étude NEJM, Fernando Polack. <a href="/studies/verifying_170_cases?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">Nous avons vérifié les sujets retenus pour l'analyse d'efficacité</a> localisés par l'équipe 3 du DailyClout</a>, et désiré calculer le taux d'incidence par site.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Il faut aussi souligner, comme mentionné page 24 <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-050222/125742_S1_M5_c4591001-S-csdrg.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">de ce document</a> que des "sites virtuels" ont été créés et intégrés dans l'"identifiant unique" du patient. Ce point est important car le site 4444, site virtuel du site 1231, apparaît souvent dans les résultats d'efficacité.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		Enfin, comme cela avait déjà été souligné par Arkmedic (via l'une de ses nombreuses anciennes incarnations Twitter (censurées), Jikkyleaks, archivée sur Telegram <a href="https://t.me/jikkyleaks">ici</a>), toutes les analyses d'écouvillons ont été faites dans le laboratoire Pearl River de Pfizer à New York - même si une analyse locale avait été réalisée par le laboratoire du site d'essai.

			</div>
	    </div>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		Cette prévalence du laboratoire central est soulignée dans le <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-030122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-protocol.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">Protocole du 2 mars 2021</a>, alors qu'elle ne figure pas dans la <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-050222/125742_S1_M5_5351_bnt162-01-interim3-protocol.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">version du protocole</a> du 27 Novembre 2020.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		Quand un conflit survenait entre les résultats du laboratoire central et ceux du laboratoire local, les seuls résultats retenus étaient ceux du laboratoire central.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <h2>Méthodologie</h2>
	    La donnée a été automatiquement téléchargée depuis le site de PHMPT, extraite, et convertie en des fichiers facilement traitables. Le code a été écrit <a href="https://www.perl.org/" target="_blank">en utilisant Perl 5</a>, et les dépendances requises sont documentées sur <a href="/data?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">cette page</a>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Les programmes & données sont librement accessibles, et détaillés plus avant dans la section <b>Détails de Méthodologie</b>. Les librairies additionnelles (en sources ouvertes) ont été documentées quand requises.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    <h2>Résultats</h2>
	    Nous avons utilisé, à cette date, plusieurs types de sources utiles dans nos tentatives de reproduire les calculs du NEJM :
		<ul>
			<li>260 Documents PDF, détaillés dans le <a href="/doc/pfizer_trials/pfizer_pdf_files_subjects.xlsx" download>fichier .XLSX suivant</a></li>
			<li>80 Fichiers XPT, détaillés dans le <a href="/doc/pfizer_trials/pfizer_sas_files_subjects.xlsx" download>fichier .XLSX suivant</a></li>
			<li>27 Fichiers XLSX, extraits des fichiers SAS</li>
		</ul>
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    Cet article s'est attaché à reproduire les chiffres communiqués au NEJM par Pfizer & Biontech en ce qui concerne le sous-ensemble efficacité. Cela nous a conduit à souligner que les chiffres figurant dans l'étude NEJM & dans le mémorandum FDA étaient flous, <b>et parfois contradictoires (1)</b>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		La plupart des chiffres de population présentés dans l'étude ne sont en aucun cas reproductibles compte tenu de l'état actuel des données et <b>mettent en évidence de multiples anomalies (2)</b>.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	    La raison pour laquelle certains patients n'ont pas été inclus dans les données d'efficacité, alors qu'ils semblent avoir été testés positifs avant la date limite des données, est particulièrement obscure, en particulier dans l'article du NEJM (4).
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		Enfin, une séquence de 8 sujets testés positifs sur le seul site argentin semble <b>peu susceptible d'être apparue par hasard dans le cadre d'un essai intègre et randomisé (4).</b>

		<div class="text_separator"></div>

		Comme souligné, les données de randomisation ne correspondent pas entre la FDA et le NEJM, avec <b>103 sujets supplémentaires</b> dans le memorandum FDA.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		L'un des rares points de concordance entre ces deux documents est que 43 448 sujets auraient été injectés avec une première dose. Cependant, bien que ce soit l'un des groupes correctement documentés dans les fichiers .PDF, les tentatives de reproduire ce sous-groupe selon les critères de l'essai ont été infructueuses.

			<li>Deux fichiers SAS gardent la trace de l'initialisation de <b>48 091 sujets</b>.</li>
			<ul>
				<div class="text_separator"></div>
				<li>FDA-CBER-2021-5683-0169082-to-0171523_125742_S1_M5_c4591001-S-D-suppdm.xpt</li>

			</ul>
			<div class="text_separator"></div>
			<li>3108 de ces sujets n'apparaissent dans aucun fichier PDF. Une liste de "44 959 sujets probablement revus" a été générée en parcourant les fichiers PDF & SAS - mais ce chiffre pourrait inclure quelques rares doublons. Quand aucune date de revue n'était documentée, nous l'avons évaluée sur la base de son ordre d'apparition dans le fichier .XPT, après avoir vérifié qu'ils étaient bien incrémentaux pour les <b>44 404 sujets</b> dont la date de revue était connue. Le dernier sujet (sujet 44442322) apparait aussi dans les fichiers de démographie comme le dernier sujet recruté par le site virtuel 4444 (site 1231) <b>le 27 Septembre 2020</b>.</li>
			<div class="text_separator"></div>
			<li>Nous pouvons spéculer, sur la base de ces données, que les "44 820 sujets revus" cités dans la table 1 de l'étude NEJM ont été établis uniquement en intégrant les sources dont le fond a été surligné en vert clair. <b>La raison pour laquelle des sujets qui sont présents dans des analyses de laboratoire, ou dans le fichier ADVA, seraient exclus du champ des "sujets revus" n'est pas claire.</b></li>
			<div class="text_separator"></div>
			<li>Les données de randomisation ont été extraites des fichiers .PDF. Quand aucune donnée de randomisation n'était disponible (102 sujets dans les fichiers ADVA), la date de randomisation a été définie à la date de la première vaccination (comme c'est le cas pour la plupart des sujets). <b>La raison pour laquelle nous avons un écart de 5 sujets avec le mémorandum FDA n'est pas claire; et par conséquent un écart de 108 sujets avec les chiffres du NEJM ne l'est guère plus.</b></li>
			<div class="text_separator"></div>
			<li>Les doses injectées ont été reconstruites en utilisant le fichier ADVA et les fichiers PDF de randomisation. Il est, à nouveau, surprenant que <b>102 sujets</b> du fichier ADVA n'apparaissent pas dans les fichiers de randomisation - ainsi que 27 sujets présents dans les fichiers de randomisation qui n'apparaissent pas dans le fichier ADVA.</li>

		Nous n'avons pas pu trouver d'explication pour ces 5 sujets <i>(10461292, 11471037, 11471145, 12231001, 12321087)</i> se démarquant comme ayant reçu deux doses mais n'ayant pas de données ADVA. <i>10361096</i> a été incarcéré, mais aurait quand même dû effectuer des analyses pour recevoir deux doses.

		En aparté, on notera qu'alors qu'on identifie 43 655 sujets randomisés, 43 661 patients auraient été recrutés par Pfizer & BioNTech selon cet article du New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html" target="_blank">"2 entreprises affirment que leurs vaccins sont efficaces à 95 %. Qu'est-ce que cela signifie?"</a>. Un autre chiffre qui n'apparaît nulle part dans les études FDA & NEJM, le plus proche étant 43 651 dans les chiffres FDA (cf. diagramme de consort [1] ci-dessus).

		Lorsqu'ils n'ont pas été inclus dans les 170 sujets du NEJM, ils sont surlignés en jaune.

	    S'il est compréhensible que les cas postérieurs au 11 novembre aient rarement pu être traités à temps pour les avoir à disposition lorsque les résultats ont été annoncés par la presse, la raison pour laquelle ils n'ont pas été inclus lorsque l'étude a été finalisée, le 16 décembre, nous échappe.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		De plus, il est profondément difficile de comprendre pourquoi des sujets tels que 10091005, 10111148, 10951098 ou d'autres n'ont pas été inclus, dans la mesure où ils n'ont aucune exclusion préliminaire documentée.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		Nous les étudierons plus en profondeur dans un prochain article.
	    <div class="text_separator"></div>
		Plus inquiétant, il semble particulièrement frappant que <b>le site 1231 ait pu fournir 8 cas d'affilée, chacun d'eux étant contaminé 2 à 8 jours après avoir été éligible au sous-ensemble efficacité.</b>

		Le protocole de l'étude prévoyait un taux d'incidence de 1,3 % dans le groupe placebo par an - mais l'observation réelle semble montrer un taux d'incidence plus élevé.
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		Pour fournir une approximation de la probabilité que 8 cas consécutifs n'apparaissent qu'en Argentine, alors que les autres sites étaient silencieux, nous avons exécuté une <a href="https://github.com/OpenVaet/openvaet/blob/main/tasks/pfizer_trials/monte_carlo_cases.pl" target="_blank">simulation de Monte Carlo</a>, basée sur un taux d'incidence de :
		<ul>
			<li>3.5 cas / 1000 sujets / mois pour les Etats-Unis</li>
			<li>7 cas / 1000 sujets / mois pour l'Argentine</li>
			<li>3 cas / 1000 sujets / mois pour les pays moins représentés</li>
		</ul>
		Les simulations sont résumées dans le tableau suivant ; résultant en une probabilité de <b>0,2488% que ce résultat se produise</b>.

		Une évaluation imparfaite, bien sûr, car le taux d'incidence élevé de l'Argentine est contrebalancé par diverses inconnues (couples entre sujets, soignants surexposés, variantes locales).
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		Nous affinerons le modèle utilisé pour prendre en compte le taux d'incidence par État américain - les données au niveau de la granularité de la ville étant malheureusement très difficiles à trouver. La précision du fait d'utiliser les données de John Hopkins pour évaluer les tendances d'infection des sites d'essai nécessite également un examen plus approfondi.
