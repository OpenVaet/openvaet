    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    We review, in this article, a list of problems in the Pfizer/BioNTech C4591001 Trial, which came out in our attempts to reproduce the results provided by the study. 
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    Using the sponsor's data communicated to the FDA, and made available via the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency's Freedom Of Information request & lawsuits, we are able to demonstrate that multiple abnormalities are affecting the populations featured in the trial - to a proportion which may have affected the end result, <b>primarily judged on a 170 patients efficacy sub-set</b>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    In that course, most interesting articles were brought to our attention, by the DailyClout's team 3, Jeyanthi Kunadhasan, MD (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/Jkun85" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), Ed Clark, MSE, and Chris Flowers, MD (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/chrisflowersmd" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), and by anonymous whistle-blower Arkmedic (<a href="https://t.me/arkmedic" target="_blank">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://gab.com/arkmedic" target="_blank">Gab</a> | <a href="https://arkmedic.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>), highlighting multiple abnormalities in the trial.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    Benefiting from their precious insights, and desiring to verify and to be able to support their figures, we dived in with Geoff Pain, PHD  (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/GeoffPainPhD" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), and are sharing here our preliminary findings, which, we hope, will simplify the accessibility of the data for other researchers who may want to study this critically important clinical trial.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    People desiring to study the trial may also benefit from the reading of this report of interest by biostatistician Christine Cotton, <a href="https://christine-cotton.1ere-page.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ENG-Vaccine-expertise-GCP-CCotton-2022-02-14-v2_AC.pdf" target="_blank">"Evaluation of the methodological practices implemented in the Pfizer/BioNtech" trials in the development of its COVID-19 RNA-messenger vaccine in relation to Good Clinical Practices"</a>, whose summary <a href="https://twitter.com/StatChrisCotton/status/1598398931381223440" target="_blank">you can find here</a>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <h2>Preliminary facts reminder</h2>
    The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine <b>"efficacy of 95%"</b> was announced, through the press, on November 18, 2020, as per example this New-York Times Article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html" target="_blank">New Pfizer Results: Coronavirus Vaccine Is Safe and 95% Effective</a>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    On November 20, 2020, as exposed on the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download" target="_blank">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for an Unapproved Product Review Memorandum</a>, the submission process for the EUA began. This process <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download" target="_blank">took some time and ended on December 10, 2020</a>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    On December 11, 2020, a day later, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6950e2.htm?s_cid=mm6950e2_w" target="_blank">the EUA was granted by the FDA</a>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    Some of the <b>key dates</b> are summarized in the Timeline below.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	<div style="width:100%;overflow-x: auto;">
		<img src="/doc/pfizer_trials/TimelinePfizer.png">
	</div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    In the paper <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577" target="_blank">Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine</a>, published on December 31, 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM.org), by Fernando P. Polack et al., the World saw for the first time some details on the numbers backing this claim.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    As established by the document <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-060122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-publications.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">pd-production-060122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-publications.pdf</a>, page 31 & following, the study was finalized on December 16, 2020. This document also includes the previous studies published.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	<a href="https://phmpt.org/court-documents/" target="_blank">PHMPT's FOI & lawsuits</a> allowed the public to access the documents which were supposed to stay hidden for 75 years, and which are supporting the FDA EUA & the NEJM study.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    This data is therefore partially available, even if <b>key files required to reproduce the original code, such as the ADSL file (Subject-Level Analysis Data), are still not provided</b> when this study is written, on December 8, 2022.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    This lack of transparency hasn't evolved despite <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj.o1731/rr-1" target="_blank">this recent letter from Peter Doshi to the BMJ</a> on October 07, 2022.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	The <b>Data Cut-off dates</b> featured in the NEJM study are unclear, and therefore clarified hereafter.
	<ul>
		<li>Efficacy subset data cut-off was <b>November 14</b> - but given 7 days were required post dose 2, no patient injected post November 7 was included</li>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<li>Safety subset data cut-off was <b>October 9</b> (at least 2 months of follow-up post dose 1)</li>
	</ul>
	The stated <b>Interval between injections</b> of 21 days, in the NEJM study, is misleading. As illustrated in the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577/suppl_file/nejmoa2034577_protocol.pdf" target="_blank">NEJM protocol, page 347</a> & the table 2 of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download" target="_blank">FDA Memorandum, page 18</a>, the delay is in reality an interval of <b>19 to 42 days</b>. This point was brought to our attention by The DailyClout's team 3's <a href="https://dailyclout.io/report-41-the-170-clinical-trial-participants-who-changed-the-world-pfizer-ignored-protocol-deviations-to-obtain-emergency-use-authorization-for-its-covid-19-mrna-vaccine/" target="_blank">Report 42: Pfizer’s EUA Granted Based on Fewer Than 0.4% of Clinical Trial Participants. FDA Ignored Disqualifying Protocol Deviations to Grant EUA</a>.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	This article also highlights several abnormalities which we encourage researchers to review.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	<a href="/studies/pfizer_trial_cases_mapping?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">We mapped these cases</a>, which only highlighted the importance of site 1231, led by the NEJM study's lead author, Fernando Polack. <a href="/studies/verifying_170_cases?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">We verified the listing of the subjects sustained for the efficacy case</a> located by the DailyClout team 3</a>, and desired to calculate the infection rate by site.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    It must also be emphasized, as mentioned page 24 of <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-050222/125742_S1_M5_c4591001-S-csdrg.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">this document</a> that "virtual sites" were created and integrated in the patient "unique id". It is of importance as site 4444, virtual site of site 1231, often appears in the efficacy results.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	Last, as it had been already highlighted by Arkmedic (in one of his many former (censored) Twitter incarnations, Jikkyleaks, archived on Telegram <a href="https://t.me/jikkyleaks">here</a>), every swab analysis was made in the Pfizer's Pearl River laboratory in New York - even if local analysis had been performed by the trial site lab.

	This central lab prevalence is highlighted in the <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-030122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-protocol.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">Protocol from March 2, 2021</a>, while this precision doesn't figure in the November 27, 2020 <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-050222/125742_S1_M5_5351_bnt162-01-interim3-protocol.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">version of the protocol</a>.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	When a conflict was arising between the central laboratory results & the local laboratory result, the sole results sustained were the central laboratory results.

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    Data has been automatically downloaded from the PHMPT's website, extracted & converted to processible files. The code has been written <a href="https://www.perl.org/" target="_blank">using Perl 5</a>, and the dependencies required are documented on <a href="/data?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">this page</a>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    The scripts & data are freely accessible, and detailed further in the <b>Methodology Details</b> section. Additional libraries (open source & freely accessible) have been documented when required.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <h2>Results</h2>
	We have used, to date, several type of useful sources in our attempts to reproduce the NEJM study calculations:
	<ul>
		<li>260 PDF Documents, detailed in the <a href="/doc/pfizer_trials/pfizer_pdf_files_subjects.xlsx" download>following .XLSX file</a></li>
		<li>80 XPT Files, detailed in the <a href="/doc/pfizer_trials/pfizer_sas_files_subjects.xlsx" download>following .XLSX file</a></li>
		<li>27 XLSX Files, dumps from SAS files</li>
	</ul>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    This paper focused on reproducing the figures communicated to the NEJM by Pfizer & Biontech as far as the efficacy subset was concerned. It led us to highlight that the figures featured in the NEJM study & in the FDA memorandum are vague, <b>and sometimes contradicting each other (1)</b>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	Most of the population figures featured in the study are in no way reproducible given the current state of the data and are <b>highlighting multiple anomalies (2)</b>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    It is also unclear why some patients haven't been included in the efficacy data while they appear to have tested positive prior the data cut-off - particularly in the NEJM article (4).
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	Lastly, a sequence of 8 subjects testing positive out of the sole Argentinian site appears quite <b>unlikely to have appeared by chance in the context of a fair, randomized trial (4).</b>

	As highlighted, the randomization data doesn't correspond between FDA & NEJM figures, with <b>103 more subjects</b> in the FDA memorandum.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	One of the rare points of accordance between these is that 43 448 subjects have been injected with a first dose. However, although that's one of the subjects details we have at disposal, attempts to reproduce these calculations according to the trial criteria have been unsuccessful.

	    2 - Reconstituting general population figures.

		<li>Two SAS files are keeping track of <b>48 091 subjects</b> initiations.</li>

		</ul>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<li>3108 of these subjects aren't appearing in any PDF file. A list of "44 982 subjects likely to have been screened" was generated parsing the PDF & SAS files - but this figure may include some rare duplicate subjects. When no screening date was documented, we evaluated it based in the display order of the .XPT file, after verifying that it was indeed incremental for the <b>44 404 subjects</b> for whom screening dates were known. The last subject (subject 44442322) also appears in the PDF demographic file as the last subject recruited by virtual site 4444 (site 1231) on <b>September 27, 2020</b>.</li>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<li>We can speculate, based on this data, that the "44 820 subjects screened" quoted in NEJM Table's 1 has been established only integrating the sources with a green background. <b>Why subjects who are present in lab analysis for malignancies, cerebrovascular issues, leukemia, tumors or lymphomas would have been excluded from the "screening scope" is unclear.</b></li>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<li>Randomization data has been extracted for the PDF files. When no randomization data was available (102 subjects appearing in the ADVA files), the randomization date has been set to the first vaccination date (as is the case for most subjects). <b>It is unclear why we have a 5 subjects offset with the FDA Memorandum; and therefore a 108 subjects offset with the NEJM ones.</b></li>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<li>The doses injected have been built using the randomization PDF files & the ADVA XPT file. It is unclear why <b>102 subjects</b> of the ADVA files aren't appearing in the Randomization files - along with why 27 subjects from the randomization files aren't in the ADVA file.</li>

	As a side note, while we find 43 655 subjects randomized, 43 661 patients were claimed to have been recruited by Pfizer & BioNTech in this article from the New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html" target="_blank">2 Companies Say Their Vaccines Are 95% Effective.

    While it is understandable that cases post November 11 could rarely be processed in time to have them at disposal when results were announced through the press, it is not transparent why they weren't included when the study was finalized, on December 16.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>

	The study protocol was planning for an incidence rate of 1.3% in the Placebo group a year - but the real life observation - aside for Argentina's September's anomaly, appear to show an higher incidence rate.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	To provide a first evaluation of the odds of 8 cases in a row appearing only in Argentina, while the other sites were silent, we ran a <a href="https://github.com/OpenVaet/openvaet/blob/main/tasks/pfizer_trials/monte_carlo_cases.pl" target="_blank">Monte Carlo simulation</a>, based on an incidence rate of :

	An imperfect evaluation, of course, as the overestimated Incidence rate is balanced by the unknown of couples among subjects and over-exposed healhcare workers.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	We will refine the model used to take into account incidence rate by US state - data at city granularity being, unfortunately, very hard to find. The potential false positive factor of the tests realized to feed the country scale figures also needs deeper examination.

	We automatically downloaded the documents from the Pfizer trials made available on <a href="https://phmpt.org/pfizers-documents/" target="_blank">PHMPT.org</a>, using the script <a href="https://github.com/OpenVaet/openvaet/blob/main/tasks/pfizer_documents/get_documents.pl" target="_blank">tasks/pfizer_documents/get_documents.pl</a> (Github), and converted the .PDF files to .HTML using the same script.

	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	Something one has to understand about the Pfizer trial documents released by PHMPT is that we have several editions of the same tables, which are completed by Pfizer & communicated to the FDA as the trial went along.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	For example, there are several editions of the table "16.2.8.1":
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	- One is labelled <i>"16.2.8.1 Listing of Subjects With Postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 NAAT-Positive Nasal Swab and COVID-19 Signs andSymptoms – Dose 1 All-Available Efficacy Population"</i>, which you can find in the file "pd-production-030122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-fa-interim-lab-measurements-sensitive.pdf", finalized on November 24, 2020.

	- One is labelled <i>"16.2.8.1 Listing of Subjects With First COVID-19 Occurrence After Dose 1 – Blinded Placebo-Controlled Follow-up Period – Dose 1 All-Available Efficacy Population"</i>, which you can find in the file "pd-production-070122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-lab-measurements-sensitive.pdf", finalized on April 1, 2021

		Study version 1.0, published on 2022-12-09
	</div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    We review, in this article, a list of problems in the Pfizer/BioNTech C4591001 Trial, which came out in our attempts to reproduce the results provided by the study. 
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    Using the sponsor's data communicated to the FDA, and made available via the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency's Freedom Of Information request & lawsuits, we are able to demonstrate that multiple abnormalities are affecting the populations featured in the trial - to a proportion which may have affected the end result, <b>primarily judged on a 170 patients efficacy sub-set</b>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    In that course, most interesting articles were brought to our attention, by the DailyClout's team 3, Jeyanthi Kunadhasan, MD (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/Jkun85" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), Ed Clark, MSE, and Chris Flowers, MD (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/chrisflowersmd" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), and by anonymous whistle-blower Arkmedic (<a href="https://t.me/arkmedic" target="_blank">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://gab.com/arkmedic" target="_blank">Gab</a> | <a href="https://arkmedic.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>), highlighting multiple abnormalities in the trial.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    Benefiting from their precious insights, and desiring to verify and to be able to support their figures, we dived in with Geoff Pain, PHD  (<a href="https://gettr.com/user/GeoffPainPhD" target="_blank">Gettr</a>), and are sharing here our preliminary findings, which, we hope, will simplify the accessibility of the data for other researchers who may want to study this critically important clinical trial.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    People desiring to study the trial may also benefit from the reading of this report of interest by biostatistician Christine Cotton, <a href="https://christine-cotton.1ere-page.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ENG-Vaccine-expertise-GCP-CCotton-2022-02-14-v2_AC.pdf" target="_blank">"Evaluation of the methodological practices implemented in the Pfizer/BioNtech" trials in the development of its COVID-19 RNA-messenger vaccine in relation to Good Clinical Practices"</a>, whose summary <a href="https://twitter.com/StatChrisCotton/status/1598398931381223440" target="_blank">you can find here</a>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <h2>Preliminary facts reminder</h2>
    The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine <b>"efficacy of 95%"</b> was announced, through the press, on November 18, 2020, as per example this New-York Times Article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html" target="_blank">New Pfizer Results: Coronavirus Vaccine Is Safe and 95% Effective</a>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    On November 20, 2020, as exposed on the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download" target="_blank">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for an Unapproved Product Review Memorandum</a>, the submission process for the EUA began. This process <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download" target="_blank">took some time and ended on December 10, 2020</a>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    On December 11, 2020, a day later, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6950e2.htm?s_cid=mm6950e2_w" target="_blank">the EUA was granted by the FDA</a>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    Some of the <b>key dates</b> are summarized in the Timeline below.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	<div style="width:100%;overflow-x: auto;">
		<img src="/doc/pfizer_trials/TimelinePfizer.png">
	</div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    In the paper <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577" target="_blank">Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine</a>, published on December 31, 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM.org), by Fernando P. Polack et al., the World saw for the first time some details on the numbers backing this claim.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    As established by the document <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-060122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-publications.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">pd-production-060122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-publications.pdf</a>, page 31 & following, the study was finalized on December 16, 2020. This document also includes the previous studies published.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	<a href="https://phmpt.org/court-documents/" target="_blank">PHMPT's FOI & lawsuits</a> allowed the public to access the documents which were supposed to stay hidden for 75 years, and which are supporting the FDA EUA & the NEJM study.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    This data is therefore partially available, even if <b>key files required to reproduce the original code, such as the ADSL file (Subject-Level Analysis Data), are still not provided</b> when this study is written, on December 8, 2022.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    This lack of transparency hasn't evolved despite <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj.o1731/rr-1" target="_blank">this recent letter from Peter Doshi to the BMJ</a> on October 07, 2022.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	The <b>Data Cut-off dates</b> featured in the NEJM study are unclear, and therefore clarified hereafter.
	<ul>
		<li>Efficacy subset data cut-off was <b>November 14</b> - but given 7 days were required post dose 2, no patient injected post November 7 was included</li>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<li>Safety subset data cut-off was <b>October 9</b> (at least 2 months of follow-up post dose 1)</li>
	</ul>
	The stated <b>Interval between injections</b> of 21 days, in the NEJM study, is misleading. As illustrated in the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577/suppl_file/nejmoa2034577_protocol.pdf" target="_blank">NEJM protocol, page 347</a> & the table 2 of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download" target="_blank">FDA Memorandum, page 18</a>, the delay is in reality an interval of <b>19 to 42 days</b>. This point was brought to our attention by The DailyClout's team 3's <a href="https://dailyclout.io/report-41-the-170-clinical-trial-participants-who-changed-the-world-pfizer-ignored-protocol-deviations-to-obtain-emergency-use-authorization-for-its-covid-19-mrna-vaccine/" target="_blank">Report 42: Pfizer’s EUA Granted Based on Fewer Than 0.4% of Clinical Trial Participants. FDA Ignored Disqualifying Protocol Deviations to Grant EUA</a>.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	This article also highlights several abnormalities which we encourage researchers to review.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	<a href="/studies/pfizer_trial_cases_mapping?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">We mapped these cases</a>, which only highlighted the importance of site 1231, led by the NEJM study's lead author, Fernando Polack. <a href="/studies/verifying_170_cases?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">We verified the listing of the subjects sustained for the efficacy case</a> located by the DailyClout team 3</a>, and desired to calculate the infection rate by site.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    It must also be emphasized, as mentioned page 24 of <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-050222/125742_S1_M5_c4591001-S-csdrg.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">this document</a> that "virtual sites" were created and integrated in the patient "unique id". It is of importance as site 4444, virtual site of site 1231, often appears in the efficacy results.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	Last, as it had been already highlighted by Arkmedic (in one of his many former (censored) Twitter incarnations, Jikkyleaks, archived on Telegram <a href="https://t.me/jikkyleaks">here</a>), every swab analysis was made in the Pfizer's Pearl River laboratory in New York - even if local analysis had been performed by the trial site lab.

	This central lab prevalence is highlighted in the <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-030122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-protocol.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">Protocol from March 2, 2021</a>, while this precision doesn't figure in the November 27, 2020 <a href="/pfizearch/viewer?pdf=pfizer_documents/native_files/pd-production-050222/125742_S1_M5_5351_bnt162-01-interim3-protocol.pdf&currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>">version of the protocol</a>.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	When a conflict was arising between the central laboratory results & the local laboratory result, the sole results sustained were the central laboratory results.

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    Data has been automatically downloaded from the PHMPT's website, extracted & converted to processible files. The code has been written <a href="https://www.perl.org/" target="_blank">using Perl 5</a>, and the dependencies required are documented on <a href="/data?currentLanguage=<%=$currentLanguage%>" target="_blank">this page</a>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    The scripts & data are freely accessible, and detailed further in the <b>Methodology Details</b> section. Additional libraries (open source & freely accessible) have been documented when required.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    <h2>Results</h2>
	We have used, to date, several type of useful sources in our attempts to reproduce the NEJM study calculations:
	<ul>
		<li>260 PDF Documents, detailed in the <a href="/doc/pfizer_trials/pfizer_pdf_files_subjects.xlsx" download>following .XLSX file</a></li>
		<li>80 XPT Files, detailed in the <a href="/doc/pfizer_trials/pfizer_sas_files_subjects.xlsx" download>following .XLSX file</a></li>
		<li>27 XLSX Files, dumps from SAS files</li>
	</ul>
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    This paper focused on reproducing the figures communicated to the NEJM by Pfizer & Biontech as far as the efficacy subset was concerned. It led us to highlight that the figures featured in the NEJM study & in the FDA memorandum are vague, <b>and sometimes contradicting each other (1)</b>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
	Most of the population figures featured in the study are in no way reproducible given the current state of the data and are <b>highlighting multiple anomalies (2)</b>.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>
    It is also unclear why some patients haven't been included in the efficacy data while they appear to have tested positive prior the data cut-off - particularly in the NEJM article (4).
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	Lastly, a sequence of 8 subjects testing positive out of the sole Argentinian site appears quite <b>unlikely to have appeared by chance in the context of a fair, randomized trial (4).</b>

	As highlighted, the randomization data doesn't correspond between FDA & NEJM figures, with <b>103 more subjects</b> in the FDA memorandum.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	One of the rare points of accordance between these is that 43 448 subjects have been injected with a first dose. However, although that's one of the subjects details we have at disposal, attempts to reproduce these calculations according to the trial criteria have been unsuccessful.

		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<li>3108 of these subjects aren't appearing in any PDF file. A list of "44 982 subjects likely to have been screened" was generated parsing the PDF & SAS files - but this figure may include some rare duplicate subjects. When no screening date was documented, we evaluated it based in the display order of the .XPT file, after verifying that it was indeed incremental for the <b>44 404 subjects</b> for whom screening dates were known. The last subject (subject 44442322) also appears in the PDF demographic file as the last subject recruited by virtual site 4444 (site 1231) on <b>September 27, 2020</b>.</li>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<li>We can speculate, based on this data, that the "44 820 subjects screened" quoted in NEJM Table's 1 has been established only integrating the sources with a green background. <b>Why subjects who are present in lab analysis for malignancies, cerebrovascular issues, leukemia, tumors or lymphomas would have been excluded from the "screening scope" is unclear.</b></li>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<li>Randomization data has been extracted for the PDF files. When no randomization data was available (102 subjects appearing in the ADVA files), the randomization date has been set to the first vaccination date (as is the case for most subjects). <b>It is unclear why we have a 5 subjects offset with the FDA Memorandum; and therefore a 108 subjects offset with the NEJM ones.</b></li>
		<div class="text_separator"></div>
		<li>The doses injected have been built using the randomization PDF files & the ADVA XPT file. It is unclear why <b>102 subjects</b> of the ADVA files aren't appearing in the Randomization files - along with why 27 subjects from the randomization files aren't in the ADVA file.</li>

	As a side note, while we find 43 655 subjects randomized, 43 661 patients were claimed to have been recruited by Pfizer & BioNTech in this article from the New York times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html" target="_blank">2 Companies Say Their Vaccines Are 95% Effective.

    While it is understandable that cases post November 11 could rarely be processed in time to have them at disposal when results were announced through the press, it is not transparent why they weren't included when the study was finalized, on December 16.
    <div class="text_separator"></div>

	The study protocol was planning for an incidence rate of 1.3% in the Placebo group a year - but the real life observation - aside for Argentina's September's anomaly, appear to show an higher incidence rate.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	To provide a first evaluation of the odds of 8 cases in a row appearing only in Argentina, while the other sites were silent, we ran a <a href="https://github.com/OpenVaet/openvaet/blob/main/tasks/pfizer_trials/monte_carlo_cases.pl" target="_blank">Monte Carlo simulation</a>, based on an incidence rate of :

	An imperfect evaluation, of course, as the overestimated Incidence rate is balanced by the unknown of couples among subjects and over-exposed healhcare workers.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	We will refine the model used to take into account incidence rate by US state - data at city granularity being, unfortunately, very hard to find. The potential false positive factor of the tests realized to feed the country scale figures also needs deeper examination.

	Something one has to understand about the Pfizer trial documents released by PHMPT is that we have several editions of the same tables, which are completed by Pfizer & communicated to the FDA as the trial went along.
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	For example, there are several editions of the table "16.2.8.1":
	<div class="text_separator"></div>
	- One is labelled <i>"16.2.8.1 Listing of Subjects With Postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 NAAT-Positive Nasal Swab and COVID-19 Signs andSymptoms – Dose 1 All-Available Efficacy Population"</i>, which you can find in the file "pd-production-030122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-fa-interim-lab-measurements-sensitive.pdf", finalized on November 24, 2020.

	- One is labelled <i>"16.2.8.1 Listing of Subjects With First COVID-19 Occurrence After Dose 1 – Blinded Placebo-Controlled Follow-up Period – Dose 1 All-Available Efficacy Population"</i>, which you can find in the file "pd-production-070122/125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-lab-measurements-sensitive.pdf", finalized on April 1, 2021
