No records were available for review from the previous facility. On April 17th I visited the facility        ( Saturday) and patient was one of the patients that had a request for the vaccine. I could not obtain her previous medical records; as I mentioned site was down that weekend. So I proceeded to performa vaccination on her. Family was not available on the phone either. Later on it became known to us that she had received two Pfizer vaccines at her previous LTC facility.. On the day of her visit , a Hospice Consult was requested. She was under Hospice care until she expired of natural causes more than 3 months later. No adverse events were noted though the family is very unhappy with hte fact that she received 3 vaccinations",

She was vaccinated in March with Pfizer. On this admission, she was on the hospitalist service from 9/16 to 9/21, when she was transferred to the ICU service for ongoing hypoxia. She was on the ICU service 9/21-9/25 and never intubated, but was on max Bipap support and iNO. She was transferred back to the hospitalist service 9/26 but remained in the ICU due to having to be on iNO. Other treatments included tociluzumab, remdesivir, and high dose steroids.     Unfortunately, despite all of these treatments, she did not improve, and in fact, worsened to the point where the next step would be intubation. Palliative care was consulted, and she said that she would not want to be on a ventilator long term. If she were intubated, she would likely never be extubated, so being intubated did not align with her wishes. She opted to be DNR/I.

Patient was treated with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and baricitinib. Ultimately had progressive hypoxemia requiring mask BiPAP making it difficult to eat or drink and on the evening of 9/30 was intubated.  Over the next 7 days he continued to deteriorate with worsening hypoxemia requiring prone ventilation strategy.  Despite maximization of ventilator efforts he never improved.  Moreover, he developed persistent hypotension and renal failure with minimal urine output ultimately with acidosis and hyperkalemia.  Palliative care was involved with family discussions.

A 60-year-old woman developed brain death secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia following concomitant administration of methotrexate, rituximab and tozinameran [routes not stated; not all dosages and outcomes stated]. The woman, who had a medical history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus, had been receiving treatment with rituximab, methotrexate 25mg per week and unspecified steroids. She had also been receiving apixaban for atrial fibrillation. On 02May2021, she presented to the hospital with fever (maximum temperature 104 degree F) and productive cough for a duration of one week. She had been vaccinated with tozinameran [Pfizer] for prevention of COVID-19 disease and received the second dose of vaccination on 18February2021. On 01April2021, she underwent routine COVID testing. At that time, she was tested positive; however, she was asymptomatic. On 24April2021, she developed productive cough and fever. Therefore, she was presented to the hospital. On day of hospital presentation, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for COVID-19 was found to be positive. Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, COVID-19 pneumonia was considered. Therefore, the woman was admitted to the hospital on 03May2021. On hospital admission, her therapy with methotrexate was stopped and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies were found to be negative. On 09May2021, she was admitted to the ICU due to acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Therefore, she received a complex course of treatment including unspecified broad spectrum antibacterial antibiotics, remdesivir and high-dose unspecified steroids for prevention of lupus flair. During the initial 5 days of hospitalisation, she continued receiving apixaban therapy, which was subsequently stopped due to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation. On admission day 13, an altered mental status was observed, and she also reported headache. Subsequent head CT revealed a new acute to subacute infarct involving the right frontal operculum and insular region, new parenchymal haemorrhage versus haemorrhagic infarct involving the left parietal lobe and left cerebellar hemisphere and multifocal acute subarachnoid haemorrhage. The CT angiogram of the head and neck showed no definite evidence of an acute large vessel intracranial arterial occlusion or substantial arterial stenosis; however, multifocal irregularity within the superior sagittal sinus with sinus venous thrombosis were noted. The brain MRI performed on the following day showed acute left middle cerebral artery territory infarct and evolution of right frontal lobe infarcts on diffusion weight imaging. The contrast-enhanced venogram showed non-occlusive superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. After interdisciplinary discussion with haematology, neurosurgery and neurology, the woman was treated with heparin drip. On admission day 19, head CT showed continued expected evolution of infarcts with sulcal effacement surrounding the dominant left sided infarcts and trace rightward midline shift. On admission day 35, final head CT revealed cessation of contrast opacification of the anterior and posterior intracranial arterial circulation as well as new cerebral oedema with effacement of the gray-white matter borders, sulci, ventricles and cisterns, haemorrhage in the right frontal and left frontoparietal lobes at the site of previous infarctions, and new hyperdensity in the sylvian fissures consistent with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, brain death secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia following pharmacodynamic interaction between methotrexate, rituximab and tozinameran was considered. Additionally, acute cerebrovascular disease was considered. Subsequently, she died due to COVID-19 pneumonia.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of Rituximab and Methotrexate Sodium in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of Rituximab and Methotrexate Sodium has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.; Sender's Comments: Based on a temporal association and known product safety profile, a causal relationship between the reported events and suspect drugs were  assessed as possible.

History is obtained from chart review as well as discussion with the patient, her husband at bedside, and the ED provider.  Patient has a history of breast cancer in 2011 which required a partial right mastectomy.  She then was diagnosed with multiple myeloma approximately 5 years ago per she completed a course of chemotherapy and had good results without evidence of monoclonal protein on follow-up 24 urine in 2020. She developed essential thrombocytosis and was diagnosed with a right lower extremity arterial occlusion in 2018 requiring right superficial femoral thrombectomy.  Her platelet count at that time was greater than 1 million and has been on hydroxyurea since that time. She is also on Plavix at baby aspirin daily.  She has had frequent blood transfusions for ongoing anemia.  She did develop hemochromatosis secondary to the frequent transfusions and was placed on a chelating agent in the last couple of months.  She states she has been having quite a bit of diarrhea after starting that medication. Also had increasing weakness along with shortness of breath.  Her last transfusion of PRBCs was on the 15th. She was seen in urgent care earlier this week and diagnosed with a UTI given nitrofurantoin.  Continued to have increasing weakness and really unable to even stand at this time.  At baseline she does not require any assistive device to walk.  In the ER she was found to have a continued urinary tract infection along with fever. Hemoglobin also less than 7 and receiving 1 unit PRBCs. She does admit to having fevers and chills along with decreased appetite.  Not having abdominal pain.  She has noticed increasing lower extremity swelling which is unusual for her.  11/12/21: Patient is an 81-year-old female with past medical history of multiple myeloma, breast cancer status post right partial mastectomy, JAK2 positive myeloproliferative disorder requiring frequent transfusions, essential thrombocytosis, hemochromatosis secondary to multiple transfusions, diabetes, GERD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral artery disease who presented on 10/29/2021 with chief complaint of weakness and fever.

        "narrative": "She got her vaccine, she was excessively tired.  She attributed it to being her last semester of nursing school, graduation coming up, etc.  She was working and going to school at the same time.  She was having headaches, and she was taking more than her normal amounts of Motrin and Tylenol.  She was on a trip in November, around 11/5/21 and did not go shopping with her friends and went to the car to lie down.  The next time she contacted her mother was on 11/20/21 before she flew home, and felt that she felt that she had a bladder infection.  She then called again around 11:00 AM before her flight and had diarrhea and attributed that to drinking cranberry juice on an empty stomach to relieve her bladder issues.  She made home that evening, and on 11/21/21 she made it through the day, had some Azos for bladder spasms, drinking fluids and resting until she get to the doctor on Monday.  She went to the doctor on Monday 11/22/21, and was given Nitrofurantoin, and felt that she had a residual sinus infection and bladder infection.  She only took one of those throughout that week as she was not feeling well.  She was cultured and nothing grew. She came home on 11/22/21 with severe headache, migraine and had to be escorted into the house, mother  her into a bath and gave her some Aleve PM for that and she went to bed.   She then broke out into a rash faintly on 11/23/21 on her forearms.  She did not take anything for this and then stopped the antibiotics thinking that was the reason for the reaction.   On Wednesday/Thursday she had the headache and continued to treat that, and then managed that with Motrin/Tylenol as needed for the pain (not a medicine taking person).  On Friday in the early evening that she still was not feeling well, and started complaining about her neck hurting.  Mother's thoughts went to meningitis, which she had been thinking as well, and did testing for that (in nursing school), and decided that was not the cause.  On Saturday 11/26/21 in the afternoon they were working on her graduation announcements and party invitations, and mother noticed her face was very flushed.  She took her temperature which was 100.2.    Mother told her to clear her schedule for Sunday.  On 11/28/21 they went and by that time the rash was more pronounced on her arms, back and on her trunk.    At that point it was not itchy, nothing that bad, and later that afternoon it became extremely itching, and mother gave her 5 Benadryl between 1:00 and 10:00 PM, and that's when she called her PCP.  The daughter sent pictures of her rash to her friends who were in the medical field with her and asked if they knew what it was.  They felt that it was 5th disease, and nothing to do for it but Motrin, Tylenol and Benadryl and went home and slept most of the day.    Her boyfriend scratched her back all afternoon and early evening.  Mother put Calamine lotion on her and nothing was helping the itching.  She made a phone call to her PCP, and he said that he was not sure about the diagnosis and wanted her to be seen the next morning at 8:00 AM.    Her mother found her at 3:00 AM vomiting and at 7:00 AM her father told the mother that she was still vomiting and mother went to assess her then.  At that time she was well enough to tell her that she had picked out the wrong clothes to wear to the hospital.  They were probably on the road about 7:30 and she was very unsteady according to the father, dragging her feet, very dizzy.  Mother took her to hospital.  They got to the hospital and mother got a wheelchair to the car and the daughter said \"momma, I can't do it\".  Mother went and got an orderly who helped to get in from the car to the wheelchair.  They took her back rather quickly to triage within 5 minutes.  They asked her her name and she did not respond, just stared blankly at everybody.  Then they went back out to the waiting room as they were getting a room ready for her, and she was continuously vomiting.  They got into a room and the medical assistant was getting ready to start an IV, and mother told him that she was pretty dehydrated and would be hard to find a vein, and daughter was very fidgity and stated \"I don't trust him\".  Then the nurse came in and he ended up doing the IV.  The PA came in that's when she was doing the assessment of the daughter and when she pushed down on her stomach she was coming off the table in pain. Mother believes she yelped and after the IV's were started they did the first blood draw.  The nurses came in and out, not a lot of activity during that time, 11:30 PM, waiting for blood work results ,doctors orders or so.  Around 11:30 mother yelled for help as daughter had a tonic clonic grand mal seizure.  They came in and immediately gave her antiseizure medicine (in medical report), which helped to a point.  They sent her back for a CAT scan of her head.  When she came back to the room mother states that she was reaching to the sky with her arms, feeling she may have been coming out of the seizure.  Her father had arrived at that time.  They asked them to leave as they needed a sterile environment to perform a spinal tap.  When they came back into the room they said they  had to tap her twice as they were not getting a lot of spinal fluid.  They sat with her for a while, did a teleconference call with the neurologist at the main hospital, and while they were telling her everything that had transpired during the week and watched her during that call and was pretty much in a coma.  She was breathing on her own, but not responding.  They came in around 4:00 PM and they were going to push medicines (mother did not know what), and did not push it and her heart rate jumped to 208 and alarms went off in the room and nurses station, and mother \"lost it\".  They came in the crash cart, which mother could not watch, went out into the hall.  They said that she never lost heart beat, and was shocking her to get her back into normal rhythm, which it did go back to normal.  At that time they decided to take her to another hospital by helicopter.    They flew her there, mom packed bags and her family has an EMT went to the hospital and answered the questions for the family.  When parents got to the hospital they were met by three neurologist and the Chaplin.  One of the neurologist told them if they were praying people to start praying.  They sent her for 3 CAT scan's and they took her back also for an in-depth MRI with and without contrast.  They brought her back to the room, she was still unconscious/coma.  Her were slit, a little bit opened, and the priest returned with them, read her the last rites, closed her eyes and did not regain.  The CAT scan did not show anything, and the neurologist noticed that she had something at the base and he diagnosed her with Chiari malformation.   Family came to the hospital, and she was ventilated, was breathing, and there was no brain swelling.   The nurses told the mother that she was one of them (nursing student), they told her to go home and get rest, and she did not want to do so.  She went home and then got a phone call at 3:00 AM on 11/30/21 which was the head charge nurse and she said that she did not want her to be alone and that one of the surgeons came in ready to do any surgery for her, and he did a pretty in-depth test on her and there was no response mother \"lost it\".  They came in the crash cart, which mother could not watch, went out into the hall.  They said that she never lost heart beat, and was shocking her to get her back into normal rhythm, which it did go back to normal.  At that time they decided to take her to other hospital by helicopter.

That doctor had done an indepth neurologic work up on her and informed them that she was brain dead with no brain activity around 12/1/21 at noon.  She was then kept on life support as she was an organ donor to preserve her organs and was taken to the organ donoting hospital after they pronounced her the following day.  Mother did some research and have friends who are doctors and researched transverse myelitis and mother still kept researched Guillain Barre with her symptoms. Info and then she started researching thrombocytopenia.  The key symptoms was the rash, on her legs, thighs and her nephew (EMT) noticed that right off as well.    The autopsy came back as intraparenchymal hemorrhage, peripheral and had hemorrhaged C1-C4 spinal cord.  The coroner listed her death as complications of Chiari malformation, which was felt to be very minimal, and by the time the body came back it was 8 mm, which did not show up on MRI imaging.     She was a very active person, very healthy.    Doctor/lawyer team believe it was the flu vaccine and possibly interaction with the Pfizer vaccine.",

The medical examiner has also stated that the patient's body had decayed enough, that if a clot was the suspect in the death, it would not be identified due to the decomposition of the body. Patient had not been feeling well since she had received the Moderna vaccine. The reporter thought that patient's leg pain could have been since she was running errands on 25-May-2022. She states that this could be a potential severe, rare side effect of the vaccine and finds it necessary to report it.

This patient was recently admitted for an appendectomy on 10/28/2022. He states that he had been home for a little more than a day and he had 2 falls 1 of those out of bed and another 1 onto the ground. He had difficulty getting up both times. Patient denied complaints of shortness of breath, cough. Patient stated he had a normal appetite but stated that he is constipated. Denies chest pain, headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, or dysuria. In the ER, the patient was found to be COVID-positive and requiring a supplemental oxygen. Per additional web report notes. ?This patient underwent an appendectomy on 10/28/2022, was discharged after an unremarkable hospital course, and presented to ED after having fallen twice at home within a 24-hour time span, found to be COVID-positive, and a presentation concerning for sepsis. The patient had noted that he had not had a bowel movement following surgery, however chart review demonstrates that the patient had been refused suppositories. The patient was empirically covered with zosyn and blood cultures where obtained which grew with g ram positive rods with subsequent repeat blood cultures without growth. The patient had a new oxygen requirement on admission prompting COVID treatment with dexamethason e and Remdesivir. His oxygen was subsequently weaned to one liter on the morning of 11/1/2022. That evening, a rapid response was called overhead after the patient had vomited and became profoundly hypoxic requiring an oxygen mask at 15 L. Shortly after transfer to the IC U, the patient had another emesis and aspiration event with subsequent respiratory/cardia c arrest with subsequent ROSC at first pulse check. The patient became hypotensive requiring vasopressors. Amiodarone was initiated due to new onset A-fib with RVR. Multiple blood gasses were drawn chest xrays obtained showing worsening respiratory failure and respiratory acidosis secondary to his aspiration. The patient suffered a second cardiac arrest with ROSC achieved after several rounds of CPR and epinephrine pushes. The patient's family made him a DNR following ROSC. The patient again became bradycardic at which point the family requested that we not treat and let him pass peacefully with his daughter present. The patient was pronounced dead at 01:08 on 11/02/2022. No further information",

        "narrative": "Pt. was admitted to a local Hospital on 1/7/2023 with weakness, UTI, some fluid in lungs and slightly elevated cardiac enzymes. Stayed in hospital (being given antibiotics) until discharged to an rehab facility on 1/10/2023. Remained at rehab facility until admitted back to the local Hospital on 1/20/2023 with Respiratory Distress (low Oxygen level, elevated pulse). Treated with Antibiotics for Pneumonia, and given Oxygen via Nasal Cannula. Tested NEGATIVE for Covid, RSV and Flu (did test positive for simple cold viruses eg. Rhinovirus). Discharged back to the Rehab facility on 1/24/2023. Pt. remained at the rehab facility, progressively deteriorating until he passed away on 2/6/2023. Symptoms (from what I, his daughter saw during second admission to the rehab facility): Confusion, Cough at various times (even though lungs were \"clear\"), fatigue, loss of appetite, swallowing issues (aspiration potential), profound and progressing weakness, especially of legs--needed two person assist to transfer, when prior had needed one simple assist when first admitted to the rehab facility, according to staff (prior to his subsequent readmission to the Hospital). At times, O2 level low and/or heart rate elevated (medication and eventually O2 was used to help). During his second admission to the rehab facility, several patients in nearby rooms (including his roommate) tested positive for Covid. He, however, continually tested NEGATIVE for Covid when tested many times during those days. He never did catch Covid, so maybe his \"booster' prevented THAT, but he did, at the end of his long ordeal, pass away....  Diagnoses included: Malignant Neoplasm of Prostate; Acute Cystitis without Hematuria; Weakness; Non-ST Elevation (NSTEMI) Myocardial Infarction; Anemia, Unspecified; Metabolic Encephalopathy; Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms; Presence of Left Artificial Hip Joint; Chronic Kidney Disease, Stage 3 Unspecified; Retention of Urine, Unspecified. (Also, his heart had been being monitored for some sort of arrhythmia [A-fib?].)  Personal Narrative: I am submitting this VAERS report, because several people in our family had suspected an adverse reaction to a prior Vaccine (J&J) which he had been given back on 4/2/2021 (see question # 23). 51 days later, having been found on the floor in his house by the police (on 5/23/2021), he was admitted to the hospital, and later rehab at these same facilities (Hospital and rehab facility), with extreme muscle weakness and symptoms that were very in line with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (Extreme weakness in his legs, \"pins and needles\", inability to walk, swallowing issues, loss of bladder control, etc.). However, he was diagnosed as having had Rhabdomyolysis. It became clear in the news at the time, that the J&J vaccine had been having GBS side effects. When reported by a family member to his primary care physician, he did not agree with the family's suspicions, and likely this case was never submitted to VAERS. That hospitalization/rehab stay lasted until his discharge on 7/9/2021. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been living independently at home. After that episode, he required a 24/7 hour live-in aide, was incontinent and wheelchair dependent. Thankfully, over the ensuing year and a half, he recovered to a large extent, with most of those disabilities being overcome in many ways, and he was on the verge of being able to live a bit more independently, perhaps with someone checking in now and then (but now he sadly experienced this insurmountable event).  Pt. did have one other booster prior to the current one in question, (Pfizer) on 12/1/2021, and although there were no glaring side effects, when looking back, he did have a period of fairly intense hip pain around 12/28/2021 (not quite four weeks after that booster), that thankfully resolved itself, and didn't need medical intervention. The current episode (explored in this VAERS report) involved the Moderna Bivalent booster. The symptoms and outcome were so similar to his first GBS type symptoms, that it seems best to report here. From his booster shot administration date, until the date he was admitted to the hospital was a total of 50 days, almost identical to the time it took for the first (J&J) vaccine to nearly kill him.  For this report, I reached out to the county and the organization that gave him the booster, as well as his primary care physician (to at least let them know he had passed away). Not only were they not aware of that, but I also asked if they had any policies or procedures for reporting adverse reactions, and none of them did. I think that may be one of the reasons why so few VAERS reports are submitted. It took so much effort to track all this info down, and to actually write the report. I have gladly done it in honor of my father's life, but think the medical professionals should have taken that responsibility on as a routine part of the administration of these products..  It seems that these shots are provided and injected into clients with so little oversight, and the recipients seem to only be monitored for a very short window of time, if even that. I HIGHLY suspect that these shots have long term ramifications, and my father is sadly no longer with us, likely due at LEAST in part to the effects of these products.  He had been a VERY strong person physically, and seemed puzzled that his body would not respond when he was trying to recover. Of course, he was elderly, and I realize no one lives forever here on earth. I do feel, however, that he would have had at least a few more wonderful years to spend, with visits from his children and grandchildren, if this whole Covid fear and vaccine spiral had not happened.  I think a lot of well meaning medical professionals are giving shots to people, thinking they are doing a good thing, and assuming that their clients are progressing well in their lives, and never even realizing how much disability and death those same shots are likely causing. Maybe I'm wrong, but I would hope whoever will eventually read this will at least ponder that possibility, and put an end to these \"vaccines\" and \"boosters\" before more people become disabled or lose their lives.   Originally, these Covid measures were put in place to \"protect our grandmas and grandpas\". It seems they have actually, in may ways, done the exact opposite, sadly. Thank you for letting me have at least some place to report this.",

We were told it was likely a \"medical event\", which seemed unlikely as he was very athletic and healthy. He participated in marathons and exercised frequently.

The patient's past medical history included B-cell lymphoma NOS (had cancer several years previously but had been successfully treated with chemotherapy) and Chemotherapy. Previously administered products included for Product used for unknown indication: Pfizer Covid vaccine (multiple times without problems). Past adverse reactions to the above products included No adverse event with Pfizer Covid vaccine. Concurrent medical conditions included Frailty (Frailty of old age).    In 2024, the patient received dose of mRNA-1273.815 (SPIKEVAX 2023-2024) (Intramuscular use) 1 dosage form. In 2024, the patient experienced PULMONARY OEDEMA (pulmonary edema) (seriousness criteria death, hospitalization and medically significant), CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (AEScongestive cardiac failure) (seriousness criteria death, hospitalization and medically significant), AORTIC STENOSIS (aortic stenosis) (seriousness criteria death, hospitalization and medically significant) and MYOCARDIAL ISCHAEMIA (ischaemic heart disease) (seriousness criteria death, hospitalization and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized on sometime in May 2024 due to AORTIC STENOSIS, CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE, MYOCARDIAL ISCHAEMIA and PULMONARY OEDEMA. The patient died on 23-May-2024. The reported cause of death was Congestive cardiac failure, Aortic stenosis, Ischaemic heart disease, frailty of old age and large b cell lymphoma. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed.            No concomitant medication was reported. Patient's date of birth was reported as 1928.  Patient was frail 95-year-old who started feeling unwell, notably shortness of breath, the day after receiving a Moderna Covid shot (late April/early May). She deteriorated and was taken into hospital about a week or 2 later (early May) where she was diagnosed with pulmonary edema and were treating her for that before she passed away on 23-May. She was frail and had multiple health problems. The death certificate lists the cause of death as: 1) Congestive cardiac failure/aortic stenosis and ischaemic heart disease, and 2) Frailty of old age and large B cell lymphoma.  As per reporter, although patient was physically frail, she was mentally fine, and strongly felt that deterioration/shortness of breath was attributable to the vaccine.  It was unknown if the patient experienced any additional symptoms/events.  No treatment medication was reported.

LITERATURE REFERENCE:    The patient's past medical history included Coronary artery disease (Right), Aortic regurgitation and Stent placement. Previously administered products included for Product used for unknown indication: Pfizer (first 5 doses). Past adverse reactions to the above products included No adverse reaction with Pfizer. Concurrent medical conditions included Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Hyperlipidemia and Gastroesophageal reflux disease.    On an unknown date, the patient received sixth dose of SPIKEVAX NOS (SPIKEVAX NOS) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date,  after starting SPIKEVAX NOS (SPIKEVAX NOS), the patient experienced INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (Interstitial lung disease) (seriousness criteria death, hospitalization and medically significant), CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING POLYRADICULONEUROPATHY (Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy) (seriousness criteria death, hospitalization and medically significant), CARDIAC FAILURE (Right-sided heart failure) (seriousness criteria death, hospitalization and medically significant), VASOCONSTRICTION (Hypoxic vasoconstriction) (seriousness criteria death, hospitalization and medically significant) and ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (STEMI) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and life threatening). The patient was treated with DEXAMETHASONE at an unspecified dose and frequency; IMMUNOGLOBULINS NOS (IMMUNOGLOBULIN I.V) (intravenous use) at an unspecified dose and frequency; NOREPINEPHRINE BITARTRATE (LEVOPHED) at an unspecified dose and frequency and PHENYLEPHRINE at an unspecified dose and frequency. The patient died on an unknown date. The reported cause of death was Interstitial lung disease, Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, right-sided heart failure and hypoxic vasoconstriction. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. At the time of death, ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (STEMI) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody: Negative. On an unknown date, Anti-ganglioside antibody: Negative. On an unknown date, Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody: (Negative) P-ANCA, C-ANCA. On an unknown date, Antinuclear antibody: Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative and Negative. On an unknown date, Biopsy muscle: confirmed the diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). On an unknown date, Blood creatine phosphokinase: within normal limits. On an unknown date, Blood immunoglobulin G: Monoclonal protein serum levels were measured which revealed low IgG. On an unknown date, Computerised tomogram thorax: showed ground glass opacities consistent with ongoing and diffuse ILD and burst dose steroids were initiated. On an unknown date, Digital radiogram: were highly suggestive of interstitial lung disease (ILD). On an unknown date, Electrocardiogram: revealed a STEMI. On an unknown date, Electromyogram: showed proximal myopathy concerning for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). On an unknown date, HMG CoA reductase antibody test: Negative. On an unknown date, Immunoglobulins: all other immunoglobins were within normal limits. On an unknown date, Mean arterial pressure: dropping below 65 mmHg. On an unknown date, Myoglobin blood: Negative. On an unknown date, Rheumatoid factor: Negative. On an unknown date, Troponin I: 608 ng/L elevated. On an unknown date, Ultrasound scan: Point of care ultrasound showed a dilated right ventricle with left ventricular collapse.     For SPIKEVAX NOS (SPIKEVAX NOS) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications were not reported.  Patient not had symptoms of ILD or CIDP prior to the administration of the Moderna COVID-19 booster. Patient presented to the emergency department with Shortness of breath (three-month history of worsening shortness of breath requiring recurrent hospitalizations). Before admission, the patient was started on dexamethasone with the onset of respiratory symptoms and achieved a partial response. On admission, the initial infectious workup was negative. About a week later, the patient developed bilateral leg weakness. In an attempt to elucidate the cause of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a paraneoplastic panel was ordered, which was negative. The patient was placed on Bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP).  Despite a battery of negative laboratory results, the patient started a course of IVIG for interstitial lung disease (ILD) with CIDP and was unresponsive to therapy.  Over the next week, the patient's respiratory effort continued to decline, requiring intubation and subsequent transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). While admitted to the ICU, hemodynamic instability, requiring maximum dose pressors. The patient passed away one day later due to right-sided heart failure likely secondary to ILD progression versus hypoxic vasoconstriction.  Author concluded that this case would be the first documented case of concurrent development of ILD and CIDP after the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, which ultimately led to patient mortality.  Company Comment: This is a Literature non-study case concerning a 76-year-old male patient, with relevant medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes type 2, stent placement and hyperlipidemia, who experienced fatal events of Interstitial lung disease (ILD), Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) (AESI), Cardiac failure (AESI) and Vasoconstriction, and the unexpected and serious (due to life-threatening, hospitalization and medically significant) AESI of Acute myocardial infarction, which occurred after SPIKEVAX NOS vaccine, administered as sixth dose within COVID-19 vaccination schedule. Prior five doses were administered with Pfizer vaccine. As reported, the patient presented to the emergency department with a three-month history of worsening shortness of breath requiring recurrent hospitalizations and intermittent BiPAP. The patient's symptoms began two weeks after his 6th dose of SPIKEVAX NOS. Before admission, the patient was started on dexamethasone with the onset of respiratory symptoms and achieved a partial response. On admission, the initial infectious workup was negative, and CT chest showed ground glass opacities consistent with ongoing and diffuse ILD, and burst dose steroids were initiated. About a week later, the patient developed bilateral leg weakness (serum CPK within normal limits), and electromyogram showed proximal myopathy concerning for CIDP, which was consistent with the results of the muscle biopsy. In an attempt to elucidate the cause of CIPD, a paraneoplastic panel was ordered, which was negative. Autoimmune workup including ANA, cyclic citrullinated peptide, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro/La, anti-SM RNP, anti-Scl70, anti-HmG-coA reductase, anti-myoglobin associated glycoprotein, anti-ganglioside G were all negative. Monoclonal protein serum levels were measured which revealed low IgG, but all other immunoglobins were within normal limits. Despite a battery of negative laboratory results, the patient started a 5-day course of IVIG for ILD with CIDP and was unresponsive to therapy. Over the next week, the patient's respiratory effort continued to decline, requiring intubation and subsequent transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). While admitted to the ICU, hemodynamic instability ensued with mean arterial pressures (MAPs) dropping below 65 mmHg, requiring maximum dose pressors (norepinephrine bitartrate and phenylephrine). EKG revealed a ST-elevation myocardial infarction, with troponin I elevated to 608 ng/L. Point of care ultrasound showed a dilated right ventricle with left ventricular collapse. The patient passed away one day later due to right-sided heart failure likely secondary to ILD progression versus hypoxic vasoconstriction.

        "narrative": "2 weeks after 2nd shot April 14) of Moderna Covid 19 - patient began feeling extremely fatigued.  Scheduled Televisit with physician and told to check back of tonsils for white spots.  Did so and told possibly Strep.   Antibiotics given.    Fatigue and increased heart rate continued.  On May 16, 2021, Patient said heart felt that was going to explode.  Went to ER and then diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) w/ FLT3 marker.   Patient was perfectly healthy prior to COVID 19 shot.  Diet considered of daily amounts of fruits, vegetables (greens) and meats.  Very healthy/balanced.  He exercised daily - resistance training and cardio.  Never  sick except for a cold.  No history of cancer in family patient was required to take the vaccine due to his company mandate and visiting healthcare facilities.   Again, a healthy individual, exceptional diet - minimal processed foods, exercised daily, not overweight and maintain a disciplined routine.  It seems more than a coincidence   the change in his health was only a couple weeks after the 2nd injection (4/14/21) of the Moderna vaccine.  He had battled this diagnosis for 4 years in/out of remission 3 times.  Ultimately passing due to complications of some of the final preventative treatments.    Previous annual physicals were all good/normal.  Could this vaccine targeted a dormant AML gene?   Did it create the cancer.  Some consulted physicians said it is a possibility but would not know for years and that is ONLY if the data is being gathered.  We know of 3 other patients that were also very healthy within a 5-20 minute radius, also diagnosed with AML and at least 1 with the FLT 3 Marker during the same time frame.  Pfizer Vac in May/June 2022 ; Pfizer Booster in Sept 2022 and SPIKEVAX Oct. 2023.    I hope the CDC and other health agencies (physicians, hospitals, etc.). help with this data gathering with patience to improve patience mortality rates and not to cause cancer, chronic illnesses or death.  We only will know what we are willing to do a \"deep dive\", study, learn, open-minded to build upon the science that constantly evolves.  We need to do the research to build to confidence level in our vaccines.   I know I'm skeptical because of knowing my husband as a healthy man at 63 and the extreme change in health in a matter of a couple weeks.  We as a country did our best to get \"something out there\" for Covid - but it may cause harm to some.",
